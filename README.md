Usually when I start hacking away at a new C++ project there are a couple of things I need:

1. A CMake file with some needed basic configurations (Universal Binaries on Mac, for example).
2. Package management to fetch external libraries
3. clang-format, clang-tidy and gitignore.

So I dediced to pack them into one template. That's pretty much it. :)
